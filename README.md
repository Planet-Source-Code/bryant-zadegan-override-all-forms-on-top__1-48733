## Override all forms on top


</div>

### Description

This "thing" takes advantage of a thoughtless mistake on microsoft's part. This prog can stay on top of anything, even the task manager! PLEASE VOTE!

-Note: I used code from Jan Alexanders Transparent form to achieve the flashing effect
 
### More Info
 
This prog includes lots of code which people might not know how to take advantage of. For example, it actually takes some code to be able to make a textbox do what u say when u press enter! that code is in there.

when u execute the code before u make any changes to it, it will be virtually impossible (havent yet found a way to kill it myself) to kill it, so move ur mouse to the upper right hand corner of ur screen, and u will see the I-beam associated with text. Click there, type "BUZZ OFF!", and press enter. this will kill the form (I programmed this into the prog)
